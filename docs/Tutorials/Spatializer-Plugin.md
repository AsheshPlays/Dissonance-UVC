# Spatializer Plugins

Since [Dissonance 7.0.2](https://placeholder-software.co.uk/dissonance/releases/7.0.2.html) Dissonance no longer supports external spatialization plugins. A change in how Unity applies spatialization has made support for this feature impossible. Unity have acknowledge this bug and we will add support back into Dissonance as soon as possible.
