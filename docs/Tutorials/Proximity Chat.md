# Proximity Chat

In this tutorial, we will build a local proximity chat system, allowing players to talk to other players who are standing near them.

We will build a chat system with two sets of channels:
1. A push-to-talk team chat room, *without* positional audio.
2. Proximity chat to nearby players, with voice activation and *with* positional audio.

This setup will allow players to speak to nearby players just by talking, and "radio" their team with a button hold. Nearby enemy players will overhear one side of the team conversation.
