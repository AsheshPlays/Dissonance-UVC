# Direct Player Messaging

This tutorial will explain how to broadcast a voice message directly to a specific player, rather than to all players in a room.

To transmit to a specific player, change the Channel Type option on the `VoiceBroadcastTrigger` to "Player", then give the player name for Recipient Player Name.
