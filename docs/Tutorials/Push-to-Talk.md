!!! Video Tutorial
    See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7qM6XditI) about push to talk activation.

When a broadcast trigger is in Push-To-Talk (PTT) mode voice will only be transmitted while the "talk" button is pressed.

To set a broadcast trigger to use PTT simply change the "Activation Mode" to "Push To Talk" and choose which input axis must be pressed for voice to be transmitted. See the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html) for how to define a new input axis.
