## Tutorial: Custom Network Integration

Dissonance is built to be completely decoupled from the underlying networking system, this allows Dissonance to run on top of various different Unity networking assets (e.g. UNet, Forge, Photon etc) just by swapping which Dissonance network component is used. Writing a new integration is a very advanced topic and should be avoided if possible! If you wish to use a publicly available networking system which Dissonance does not yet have an integration for [raise an issue](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance) and see if we'll build the integration into Dissonance. However if you're writing a custom network system and want to use Dissonance you'll have to write your own integration.
