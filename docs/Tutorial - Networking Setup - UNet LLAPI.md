## Networking Setup: UNet LLAPI

The UNet Low Level API (LLAPI) is a thin layer on top of a UDP socket which allows a developer to exchange plain binary blobs to other peers in a network session. This tutorial will guide you though integrating Dissonance into a project which already uses LLAPI. Because UNet is a low level system which is used entirely from code you will need to write a small amount of code to properly start the Dissonance session.

*UNet LLAPI integration is currently in development and will be completed before a full release of Dissonance.*
