## Licensing

Dissonances uses parts of the WebRTC project for audio preprocessing/postprocessing and the Opus codec for encoding/decoding audio. The distribution requirements for both of these projects are quite simple - you must include copies of the license in your project alongside `Opus.dll` and `AudioPluginDissonance.dll`:

 - [Opus License](https://opus-codec.org/license/)
 - [WebRTC License](https://webrtc.org/support/license/)
