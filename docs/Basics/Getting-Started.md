In this tutorial you will create a new project, import Dissonance and set up some settings required for Dissonance to work properly.

### 1. Import Dissonance

Import the Dissonance asset into the project. Every time you import a new version of Dissonance a window will pop up offering to take you to the latest changelog, you can launch this window again by navigating to `Windows > Dissonance > Welcome Screen`.

### 2. Download Integrations

On the welcome screen is a list of integrations available for Dissonance. You **must** install at a network backend integration - without this Dissonance cannot send anything over the network! Refer to [these docs](Choosing-A-Network.md) for help on choosing which one to use.

### 3. Run In Background

Multiplayer games need to keep running (and processing network packets) even when the game window does not have focus. To do this navigate to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` and enable "Run In Background".

### 4. Per Platform Specific Setup

Some platforms have special setup requirements, make sure to read the documentation for the platforms you want to work with:

 - [Android & Oculus Go](../Platforms/Android.md)
 - [iOS](../Platforms/iOS.md)
 - [Linux](../Platforms/Linux.md)
 - [MacOS](../Platforms/MacOS.md)
 - [Magic Leap](../Platforms/Magic Leap.md)
 - [Windows (Desktop)](../Platforms/Windows Desktop.md)
 - [Windows (UWP/Hololens)](../Platforms/Windows UWP & Hololens.md)
