## Tutorial: Multiple Rooms

There is a video version of this tutorial [here](TODO).

Dissonance supports multiple "rooms" for voice. Which rooms a player sends and receives from are configured by two components - a "Voice Broadcast Trigger" component controls which rooms a player sends voice to and a "Voice Receipt Trigger" component controls which rooms a player hears voice from. This system is very flexible and allows many different types of setup. For details on these components see the reference documentation for [Voice Broadcast Trigger](Reference/Components/Voice Broadcast Trigger.md) and [Voice Receipt Trigger](Reference/Components/Voice Receipt Trigger.md).

This tutorial will describe several different potential systems you may want, and how to create them. All these examples assume you already have a DissonanceVoiceComms component setup with a playback prefab and a network integration - see [Basic VoIP](Tutorial - Basic VoIP.md) (step 2) for details on how to set this up.
