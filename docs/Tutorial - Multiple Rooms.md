## Tutorial: Multiple Rooms

There is a video version of this tutorial [here](TODO).

Dissonance supports multiple "rooms" for voice. Which rooms a player sends and receives from are configured by two components - a "Voice Broadcast Trigger" component controls which rooms a player sends voice to, conversely a "Voice Receipt Trigger" component controls which rooms a player hears voice from. This system is very flexible and allows many different types of setup. This tutorial will describe several different potential systems you may want, and how to create them.
