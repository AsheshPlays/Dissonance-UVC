To run Dissonance on a Windows PC requires [Visual Studio 2019 Redist](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2019). It's recommended that you package this with your application and install it as part of your install process.

When distributing over Steam, you set is as a dependency of your app in the Redistributables menu on the Steamwork panel to have it automatically installed.
