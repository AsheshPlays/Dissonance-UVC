# Android (Including Oculus Go)

On Android you must request permission to use the microphone, see the Unity documentation for this [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html). If you use `Android 6.0` or greater and `API level 23` or greater there is a runtime permissions system which Unity makes available through the Android.Permissions, see the section titled "Runtime permissions in Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)" [on this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html).

### ARM64

Dissonance includes ARM64 binaries compatible with Android, these are only enabled in Unity 2018.1+ (Unity 2017.4 does not support ARM64).
