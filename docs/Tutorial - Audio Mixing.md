## Tutorial: Audio Mixing

There is a video version of this tutorial [here](TODO).

Dissonance does not have any special support built in for audio mixing, because unity already has a powerful mixing system built in which dissonance audio is routed through. You can find out more about the unity audio mixing system [here](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/24/mixing-sweet-beats-in-unity-5-0/). In this tutorial we're going to modify the project which we have built up in the previous tutorials ([getting started](Tutorial---Getting-Started), [channels](Tutorial---Multiple-Channels) and [positional audio](Tutorial---Positional-Audio)) to include volume ducking - whenever anyone speaks all the other sound effects in the game will become slightly quieter.

2. !!!
3. Profit :D

### More Ideas

Because dissonance audio is processed through the unity audio pipeline just like any other sound effect a huge variety of effects can be applied. However, you should use these effects cautiously - players will not appreciate a voip system which distorts or muffles speech so much that it cannot be understood!

 - Radio crackle
 - Lip Sync
 - Pause NPC speech when voice is being received
