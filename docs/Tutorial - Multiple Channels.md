## Tutorial: Multiple Channels

There is a video version of this tutotial [here](TODO).

All voice in dissonance is transmitted on a channel, players can enter and leave channels at any time and only players in a channel will hear other people talking to that channel. Depending on how channels are setup they can be used for a variety of effects such as global chat, team chat or positional rooms which are automatically joined as players move around the scene.

In this tutorial we will extend the basic setup from the [getting started](Tutorial---Getting-Started) tutorial with extra new channels. <TODO: Concrete example>
